    <p>Nomination Services refer to the process by which the Centre assists parties or appointing authorities in the selection and appointment of qualified neutrals—such as arbitrators, mediators, adjudicators, experts, or dispute board members—for the resolution of disputes.</p>
  <p>When parties are unable to agree on an appointment, or when their contract designates the Centre as the appointing body, CACAP facilitates the appointment of a qualified, independent, and impartial professional in accordance with applicable rules, standards, and the case requirements.</p>
  <p>The Centre maintains a diverse and experienced panel of dispute resolution professionals, including specialists in construction law, engineering, quantity surveying, project management, and technical analysis. Nomination services are conducted in a transparent and timely manner, in line with the dispute’s subject matter and procedural requirements.</p>
  <p>The Centre also offers emergency appointment services for time-sensitive cases and provides support in multi-party disputes requiring the appointment of multiple neutrals.</p>
