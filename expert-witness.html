    <p>Expert witness appointments involve the provision of independent, specialised knowledge and opinion by a qualified professional to assist in the resolution of disputes, typically in arbitration, litigation, or other legal proceedings. An expert witness is engaged to analyse complex technical or professional issues, prepare written reports, and, when required, provide oral testimony.</p>
  <p>Expert witnesses must remain objective and impartial, and their primary duty is to the tribunal or court, regardless of which party engages their services.</p>
  <p>The Centre maintains a panel of expert witnesses with professional qualifications in construction and project management, engineering, quantity surveying and cost estimation, programming, delay and disruption analysis, defects assessment, and contract administration and compliance.</p>
  <p>Engagement of the expert witness, including terms of appointment, scope of instructions, fees, and contractual arrangements, is conducted directly between the nominating party and the expert witness.</p>
