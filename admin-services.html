    <p>The Construction Arbitration Centre (Asia Pacific) provides limited administrative support services for arbitration, expert determination, and dispute resolution proceedings where parties have agreed to engage such services. These administrative services are designed to facilitate the efficient conduct of proceedings whilst maintaining strict neutrality regarding the substance and outcome of disputes.</p>
    <p>CACAP’s administrative role is confined to procedural coordination, documentation management, and quality control of formal documents for clarity, consistency, and professional presentation. The Centre does not participate in the merits of any dispute, does not provide advice to any party regarding substantive matters, and does not perform any decision-making functions.</p>
    <h2>Key Principles</h2>
    <ul><li><strong>Neutrality:</strong> The Centre does not provide advice or express views on the merits, substance, or outcomes of disputes.</li><li><strong>Independence of Decision-Makers:</strong> Arbitrators, expert determiners, and other neutrals operate fully independently of CACAP.</li><li><strong>Procedural Integrity:</strong> Processes conducted in accordance with established procedural standards.</li><li><strong>Limited Scope:</strong> Services provided only where parties have expressly agreed to engage such services.</li></ul>
