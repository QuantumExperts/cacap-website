    <p>Adjudication is a rapid dispute resolution process used in construction and infrastructure disputes, in which an independent adjudicator assesses the claims and submissions of the parties and issues a binding decision within a compressed timeframe. Adjudication is commonly provided for under statutory regimes or contractual provisions and is designed to ensure the prompt resolution of payment and performance disputes that arise during the course of construction projects.</p>
  <p>The Construction Arbitration Centre (Asia Pacific) serves as an appointing authority for adjudicators in construction and infrastructure disputes throughout the Asia Pacific region. Where parties require the appointment of an adjudicator under statutory or contractual adjudication provisions, or where their contract designates CACAP as the appointing authority, the Centre facilitates the nomination and appointment of qualified, independent, and impartial adjudicators.</p>
  <p>The Centre maintains a panel of adjudicators with expertise in construction law, engineering, quantity surveying, project management, and related disciplines. Once appointed, the adjudication proceeds independently in accordance with the applicable statutory or contractual adjudication rules. The Centre does not administer adjudication proceedings or participate in the conduct or substance of the adjudication.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>The process commences when a party submits a request for the appointment of an adjudicator, typically under the terms of a construction contract or pursuant to applicable statutory adjudication provisions. Given the compressed timeframes associated with adjudication, the Centre aims to complete appointments promptly. Upon appointment, the adjudicator assumes responsibility for all procedural matters and issues a binding decision within the applicable timeframe.</p>
