    <ol class="terms-list">
      <li><strong>Intellectual Property.</strong> The CACAP designations, certificate format, and accreditation framework are the exclusive intellectual property of the Construction Arbitration Centre Asia Pacific and do not derive from or replicate the credentials of any other body.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope of Accreditation.</strong> Accreditation is specific to the training course completed and the discipline assessed. It does not confer any qualification, certification, or professional standing attributable to any other institution.</li>
      <li><strong>Basis of Award.</strong> Accreditation is awarded at the discretion of the President of CACAP on the recommendation of the course instructors, having regard to performance in assessed practical sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Panel Eligibility.</strong> Accredited practitioners are eligible for inclusion on the relevant CACAP Accredited Panel, subject to the Centre’s discretion.</li>
      <li><strong>Use of Designation.</strong> Accredited practitioners may use their CACAP designation in professional materials. The designation must be reproduced accurately and not altered or abbreviated without the Centre’s consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Revocation.</strong> The Centre reserves the right to revoke accreditation in circumstances of professional misconduct, misrepresentation, or conduct that brings the Centre into disrepute.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuing Obligations.</strong> The Centre may in due course introduce continuing professional development requirements as a condition of maintaining accredited status.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="color:var(--text-light);font-size:14px;margin-top:32px;">These terms are effective from February 2026 and may be amended by the Centre from time to time.</p>
