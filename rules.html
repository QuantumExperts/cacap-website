    <p class="text-body">The Centre’s role involves the nomination and appointment of qualified neutrals. This includes receiving appointment requests, reviewing panel qualifications, conducting conflict checks, and facilitating the appointment process in accordance with the Centre’s rules.</p>
    <p class="text-body">Once a neutral is appointed, the dispute resolution proceedings are conducted independently by the appointed neutral or panel in accordance with the applicable rules agreed by the parties. The Centre does not administer proceedings, manage case files, coordinate communications, or provide logistical support.</p>
