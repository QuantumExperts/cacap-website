    <div class="gold-line"></div>
    <p>Dispute Boards involve the establishment of a standing or ad hoc panel of independent experts to provide dispute resolution support during complex construction, infrastructure, or engineering projects.</p>
  <p>A Dispute Board may be appointed at the outset of a project (standing Dispute Board) or formed when a dispute arises (ad hoc Dispute Board). The board’s role is to become familiar with the project, conduct periodic site visits, provide informal assistance, and render recommendations or decisions. The nature of the board’s determinations—whether recommendations (Dispute Review Board), binding decisions (Dispute Adjudication Board), or a combination (Combined Dispute Board)—depends on the contractual agreement between the parties.</p>
  <p>The Centre maintains a panel of Dispute Board members with expertise in construction law, engineering, quantity surveying, project management, and contract administration. Once appointed, the board operates independently throughout the project duration in accordance with the contract and applicable Dispute Board rules (such as FIDIC Dispute Board procedures, ICC Dispute Board Rules, or other recognised procedures).</p>
