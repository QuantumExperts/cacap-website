    <p>Expert determination is a private, contract-based method of dispute resolution in which the parties appoint a neutral expert with specialised knowledge in a particular field to decide a dispute, typically of a technical or valuation-related nature. Unlike arbitration or mediation, the expert’s role is to apply their professional expertise to assess the matter and render a determination, which is often final and binding.</p>
  <p>This process is particularly suited to disputes involving complex technical issues, such as those arising in construction, engineering, quantity surveying, programming and delay analysis, defects assessment, valuation, and contract interpretation.</p>
  <p>The Centre maintains a panel of experts in structural engineering, civil engineering, mechanical and electrical engineering, quantity surveying, project management, programming and delay analysis, defects assessment, and construction law.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul><li>Access to expert determiners with specialised technical knowledge.</li>
    <li>Independent and impartial appointment process with rigorous conflict checking.</li>
    <li>Determinations typically binding and final.</li>
    <li>Confidential proceedings.</li>
    <li>Efficient appointment process.</li></ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>The process commences when parties submit a request including the technical or contractual issues requiring determination, the required area of expertise, and any agreed qualifications.
