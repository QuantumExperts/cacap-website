    <p>Mediation is a structured, confidential, and voluntary process in which disputing parties seek to resolve their conflict with the assistance of a neutral and independent third party, known as a mediator. The mediator facilitates dialogue, assists parties in identifying issues, exploring options, and supports the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable settlement agreement.</p>
  <p>Mediation is non-adjudicative—the mediator does not impose a decision, determine rights, or make binding determinations. The outcome is determined by the parties themselves through negotiation and agreement.</p>
  <p>The Construction Arbitration Centre (Asia Pacific) serves as an appointing authority for mediators in construction and infrastructure disputes throughout the Asia Pacific region. The Centre maintains a panel of experienced mediators with expertise in construction disputes, contract negotiation, and facilitation techniques.</p>
  <p>Once a mediator is appointed, the mediation proceeds independently. The Centre does not administer mediation proceedings, provide case management, coordinate scheduling or communications, or participate in the conduct or substance of the mediation.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul><li>Neutral and skilled mediators with industry expertise.</li>
    <li>Confidential process to protect sensitive information.</li>
    <li>Flexible and cost-effective compared to litigation or arbitration.</li>
    <li>Focus on maintaining commercial relationships.</li></ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>The process commences when parties submit a request for the appointment of a mediator. The Centre reviews its panel, conducts conflict checks, and proposes or appoints a qualified mediator.</p><p>If the parties reach agreement, they prepare and execute a settlement agreement. If settlement is not reached, the mediation concludes without determination, and parties may pursue other dispute resolution options.</p>
