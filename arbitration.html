    <p>Arbitration provides a binding method of resolving disputes outside traditional court litigation. In arbitration, parties agree to submit their dispute to a neutral third party (the arbitrator or arbitral tribunal), who considers the evidence and submissions of both sides and issues a binding and enforceable award.</p>
  <p>Arbitration is confidential, flexible, and commonly used in construction, infrastructure, commercial, and contractual disputes.</p>
  <p>The Construction Arbitration Centre (Asia Pacific) serves as an appointing authority for arbitrators in construction and infrastructure disputes throughout the Asia Pacific region. Where parties are unable to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, or where their contract designates CACAP as the appointing authority, the Centre facilitates the nomination and appointment of qualified, independent, and impartial arbitrators in accordance with its appointment procedures.</p>
  <p>The Centre maintains a panel of experienced arbitrators with expertise in construction law, engineering, quantity surveying, project management, and related technical disciplines. The appointment process includes review of qualifications, conflict checking, and assessment of availability to ensure that appointed arbitrators possess the requisite expertise and independence for each dispute.</p>
  <p>Once an arbitrator or tribunal is appointed, the arbitration proceeds independently in accordance with the arbitration rules agreed by the parties, whether institutional rules (such as UNCITRAL, ICC, SIAC, HKIAC, or other recognised rules) or ad hoc procedures. The Centre does not administer arbitration proceedings, provide case management, coordinate communications, or participate in the conduct or substance of the arbitration.</p>
  <p>The Centre’s role is limited to the appointment function and, where applicable, determination of challenges to arbitrators, replacement of arbitrators, or resolution of disputes concerning arbitrator fees in accordance with its rules.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul><li>Impartial and independent arbitrators with specialised knowledge.</li>
    <li>Flexible procedures tailored to the needs of each dispute.</li>
    <li>Confidential proceedings to protect sensitive commercial information.</li>
    <li>Enforceable awards recognised internationally under the New York Convention.</li></ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>CACAP’s appointment process commences when parties submit a request for the appointment of an arbitrator or arbitral tribunal. The request should include details of the dispute, the required expertise, any agreed qualifications or selection criteria, and disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest.</p><p>The Centre reviews its panel, conducts conflict checks, and proposes suitable candidates or directly appoints the arbitrator or tribunal. Upon appointment, the Centre issues formal confirmation. The tribunal issues its binding award directly to the parties, enforceable internationally under the New York Convention.</p>
